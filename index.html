<h3>Stage 0</h3>  <p><i>[before the events of the main story and the characters. "Normal"]</i></p>
<p><b>Swan Mother Cygnus:</b></p>
<p>This is the tale that the characters hear at first. Whether it is wholly true or not, that we will find out later.</p>
<p>Relationship troubles with Procyon. Incident occurs (?). That night in her <a target="_blank" href="#substances">dreams</a>, visited by Don Diasco, who promises her the ability to shapeshift some of her facial features, which will allow her to wreck havoc on Procyon. The power is really a <a target="_blank" href="#catalyst-categories">curse</a>. Soon she will begin exhibiting further deformations of the body besides what she wished for, growing swan feathers. In reality, the Don just wanted to rid themselves of the curse.</p>
<p>Cygnus accepts the deal. Soon enough her face begins to transform. She is now stunningly beautiful and unrecognizable. She visits Father who is transfixed by her beauty. She is bitter and hateful but stomachs it in order to put her plan in place.</p>
<p>The two are married. Cygnus conceives two children.</p>
<p>The children, later called Ewe and Ram, are born. She planned to hang the both of them as revenge. Both children have the same curse as she does.</p>
<p>A year into the marriage the curse begins to take place. Cygnus finds swan feathers growing on her body. Plucking one off results in unimaginable pain, and the leaking of honey. Meanwhile, Cygnus practices the skill of transforming into a swan- not just her facial features. She is guided by Aman in her dreams.</p>
<p>Ewe and Ram begin to grow feathers at the age of 2. Cygnus plucks the feathers off them to hide the curse from their father.</p>
<p>Ewe and Ram are 7 years old. One day while their father is out at work, Cygnus brings them out telling them they are going out to the mountains. She pushes the both of them off and runs to collect their corpses. She carries their bodies back home and sets up two nooses and hangs them. In a box she places all their feathers and honey and takes this with her. She transforms into a swan to watchthe father's reaction. Cygnus has flown away.</p>
<p>When Father sleeps he sees a Don (same or different) as well, told that his children can be brought back to life.</p>

<p>Cygnus' crimes are discovered by ??? and she is sentenced to death. She wants to remove her curse and to preserve it for her next life (which she believes in because ???). She dreams in her cellar and sees the same Aman who gave her the curse in the first place, and asks how to preserve it. He tells her that it must be passed onto another person with a physical body (furthermore, the children both have the curse, so an opportunity is there, although Cygnus believes them to be dead).</p>
<p>She is slain and sent to the moon - the new house for the <a target="_blank" href="#soul">soul</a>. The old inhabiter of the moon is taken away, arranged by ???. As part of her punishment, she is to retain all her memories from her previous body.</p>

<p>The timeline of Cygnus' soul</p>
<ul>
<li>1: Celestial body (Alpha Cygni/ Deneb)</li>
<li>Wandering ghost</li>
<li>Animal</li>
<li>Human (where she meets Lepus as a human, receives the curse) **THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE JUST READ**</li>
<li>2: celestial body (moon, punishment)</li>
<li>Wandering ghost</li>
<li>Animal (swan) **WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO READ**</li>
<li>Human (cursed, able to transform to and from)</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">Names (such as Lepus and Cygnus) are used to pick out those characters but at the time of this story you just read (as well as the following one) they were known by different names.</div>

<p>Later: Cygnus finds herself in the body of a cygnet (baby swan). She tries to gain control of the swan family (a mother and a few cygnets). When the mother departs (death or otherwise), she has her brood, and similarly to Lepus, still feels that inexplicable sense of yearning (see her and Lepus' entry in <a target="_blank" href="#characters">characters</a> for context.</p>
<p>She tries to gain more control - she becomes stricter and looks for more recruits - not just swans, but humans. She must attract a human recruit to the image of the swan (the self-image is a Lepus concept) - by implanting feathers on her body. Madeline is chosen, as she is wrong-fitted.</p>

<p><b>Evil Rabbit Lepus:</b></p>
<p>Lepus meets Cygnus in college (18-22), he's shy and lonely. Cygnus is sociable and smart. The two become close because of similar struggles. They begin a relationship. When they're out of school they live together. Years go by, they're no longer happy together. Lepus is struggling with lifelong insecurities, while Cygnus is growing bored and restless, and seeks excitement. Lepus truly loves her because she pulled him out of his depression and loneliness years ago. Cygnus (27) begins an affair with Procyon. Lepus is suspicious of this. Later after coming home from a party Lepus freaks out, expecting to find Procyon in the apartment with her. Cygnus takes his episode as a reason to leave, and she goes to live with Procyon.</p>

<p>Lepus dies and becomes a wandering ghost. It finds Jonas' dream. In the dream it was a rabbit, so it felt an affinity for rabbits since then, a compulsive one at that. It also began to view Jonas as a key figure in its destiny.</p>
<p>Lepus seeks out the body of a rabbit to occupy. However his soul is not fit for the body, so the physical body is deformed. But Lepus believes that his soul is fit. He wants to stay in this body, but he knows that soon he will die, and become a ghost. 
<p>Don Aman tells him about <a target=_blank href="#catalyst-categories">elixir</a>. He is also told about time travel (how?)</p>
<p>In order to obtain the elixir, he needs to access the world of dreams, which as an animal he cannot do. He needs the help of a dreaming agent, a human. Lepus doesn't want to abandon his body for too long (which he would have to do in order to obtain a human body for himself), so he plans to make a dreaming agent do the work for him.</p>

<ul>
<li>Find dreaming agent.</li>
<li>Trick them into making the elixir.</li>  
<li>Have the dreaming agent die -ensure they are also a wrong fitted soul so they can become a ghost.</li>  
<li>Kill Lepus' own physical body, so he can be a ghost- then steal the elixir from the dreaming agent's ghost.</li>  
<li>Return to his body with the elixir, immortalizing it and residing in it forever.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lepus finds himself in Cabezon. He remembers when he was a ghost, he found himself in a dream similar to this place, which was Jonas' dream. He sees Jonas at Cabezon and realizes that he is the perfect candidate for his plan. As an animal, he cannot talk, and realizes he will struggle to contact Jonas in the physical world- but he also cannot appear in Jonas' dreams again. First he tries to contact Jonas in the past by time travelling into the dream, but he finds that he is unable to change anything that he did in that dream, he has only superimposed his form (of the rabbit) onto whatever it was that used to be there in Jonas' dream- which is why Jonas sees a rabbit in his dream, and why Lepus becomes attatched to the form of the rabbit.</p>
<p>He decides that he will use somebody else (Naomi) as a communicator between them. Naomi will get Jonas' attention, and lead him to Lepus.</p>

<ul>
<li>1: Celestial body</li>
<li>Wandering ghost</li>
<li>Animal</li>
<li>Human (where he meets Cygnus as a human) **YOU JUST READ THIS**</li>
<li>??? (Why does he cycle again?)
<li>2: Celestial body (Alpha Leporis/Arneb)</li>
<li>Wandering ghost (he has the dream with Jonas and Cabezon) **YOU JUST READ THIS**</li>
<li>Animal (rabbit, wrong-fitted -> physical deformations, travels back to the dream, implants the image of rabbit) **YOU JUST READ THIS**</li>
</ul>

<p><b>First trip to Cabezon</b></p>
<p>Jonas and his friends (Jacob, Michael) came here on a trip in middle school. He told his friends about a mythical beast, an evil rabbit that would come and chase them down the beach. The inspiration for this beast came from that dream with Lepus (discussed in the paragraphs above). He does not believe that the beast is real.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Naomi is on her Schoolies trip with her peers.</p>

<div id="stage1">
<h3>Stage 1</h3>  <p><i>["Normal", very close to our reality. the characters begin to discover seemingly supernatural things, but their world is largely normal. They go to school, have jobs, etc. (our main cast- jonas, etc, are in high school.)]</i></p>
<div class="note">Will be written in dot points. more detail available</div>

<ul>
<li>Jonas meets Gregg, sophomore year, while watching kids play soccer through a window. Gregg takes his picture.</li>
<li>During the school holidays, Jonas meets Ian at a skate park.</li>
<li>First week of Junior year, Jonas joins the school band. Meets Art.</li>
<li>Gregg and Jonas become better friends, shared classes. Both have oddball interests.</li>
<li>Gregg introduces Jonas to his Senior friends: Art, Aaron and Madeline. Jonas is interested in Madeline.</li>
<li>Second week of school. Gregg asks Jonas over the phone if he wants to come on a trip to the Dark Trail (Gregg will be taking photos for his project). They will be going in a car belonging to Aaron (Gregg, Jonas, Art and Aaron). Chelsea (friend of Gregg's) will be coming as well. Jonas is in charge of choosing the music for the trip.</li>
<li>Third week of school, Wednesday. On the way to the printer, Jonas and Gregg bump into Phoebe, Art's younger sister.</li>
<li>Friday, Chelsea tells Madeline about the trip to the Dark Trail. She has a spontaneuous desire to join. Gregg agrees, but doesn't tell Jonas.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div id="stage1.5">
<h3>Stage 1.5</h3> <p><i>[A peak of what's to come.]</i></p>

<ul>
<li>(12:00pm) Aaron takes an interest in Jonas due to his music taste.</li>
<li>(2:00pm) When they get out the car, they're told to wait for Madeline and Chelsea. This surprises Jonas and Aaron respectively. Gregg tells them all they need to do a bit of walking. The place they are at now is pretty sunny. Aaron is overheating but he refuses to take off his hoodie.</li>
<li>Aaron and Jonas talk while on the walk about music. Distracting both of them from Madeline and Chelsea, who are walking together, leaving Gregg in the front and Art in the back.</li>
<li>Gregg then joins Madeline and Chelsea, which changes to Gregg and Madeline. Jonas gets jealous over Gregg and Madeline - the two aren't particularly close, but they seem to have a very friendly and intimate dynamic. Aaron notices Jonas' mood, and hesitates before asking. Before he can,</li>
<li>(2:30pm) They arrive at the first bridge. Jonas notices the lack of signs or anything here, it clearly isn't a tourist spot - although Gregg mentioned that it was infamous. As they cross the bridge the grass changes to a greyish color, and soon there is hardly any grass at all, but only grey rock. To Aaron's dismay, it's still just as hot.</li>
<li>(3:00pm) The group is getting tired. Gregg suggests he goes on his own and the rest can stay here, or explore by themselves at their own pace. Art, his closest friend of the group, volunteers to go with him. Gregg gets everyone to take pictures of the map he saved from online (although it isn't very detailed - it only shows the path to the summit). They're very close to the flat field, just east of it. "Just try and find your way back East-ish, and go anywhere along this path."</li>
<li>Gregg and Art leave to climb up to the summit.Jonas, Aaron, Madeline and Chelsea walk to the flat field, and rest. Aaron wants to get away from the group, partly to get his clothes off since he's scorching. He leaves, saying he's gonna take a piss. He goes south-west into the nearby trees. This leaves Jonas with Madeline and Chelsea.</li>
<li>(3:30pm) It's been thirty minutes and Aaron is no where to be seen. Chelsea leaves to go find him, leaving Jonas and Madeline alone.</li>
<li>Don Diasco watches. It's now his time to strike. Everything has gone to plan so far, he just needs to lead the two to the terracotta cave. Speaking of the Don, where is he now? He's where the characters are, the Dark Trail.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">Who is behind the Dark Trail? The place itself is an abandoned area, and the summit a popular place for urban exploration. Gregg first heard of it from an urban exploration forum. It peaked his interest. A user (Don Diasco) posted the map and, conversing with Gregg, advised him to bring a few friends. He also advises him against using google maps because it isn't accurate - he says there are no trees around the flat field. He creates the map that Gregg prints out - he knows that Gregg will follow the path, while the others will split off. He also advises that they pair up - because he knows Gregg will pair with Art, who is closest to him. That leaves Madeline, Chelsea, Aaron and Jonas. He knows Jonas will be too shy to hang out with Madeline, and he's never met Chelsea before, so that's sorted. He must ensure that something causes the two pairs to split up and for Jonas and Madeline to meet at the Terracotta cave. The Don's plan is to bring Madeline and Jonas together - everything from the Dark Trail is orchestrated by him. He gets the help of his friend [[Don Diasco's Friend]] who has the ability to input feelings into a soul's body, which she uses on Madeline to guide her to join the journey. She agrees to do this because she owes him a favor. Because Madeline is the one who had her brain meddled with, she is the most likely to discover that something strange has been going on. Although a lot of things have been orchestrated at first, not all key points have - Gregg befriended Jonas out of his own volition, that had nothing to do with the Don's meddling. Same with Jonas falling for Madeline - Diasco only saw an opportunity there (two potential lovers) and decided to get his hands dirty.</div>

<div id="introduction">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>On Cabezon's third-substance reality:</p>
<p>The substance of the soul can materialise things in the physical world (eg. splitting of souls, ghost bodies, deformations, curses, immortalisation...) through time. Such power can come from the past, the future... (?)</p>
<p>Objects can exist in the past, the future, the present, or out of time - which is an abstract kind of place.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time">"The universe is spread out in four similar dimensions, which together make up a unified, four-dimensional manifold, appropriately called spacetime."</a></p>
</div>

<div id="substances">
<h3>Substances</h3>
<div class="note">Please note that Cabezon's "substances" have nothing to do with drugs or alcohol.</div>

<p>First substance: the physical world. Described by science.</p>
<p>Second substance: The "soul" world. Concerned with consciousness.</p>

<div class="note">All soul matter and energy was created in the big bang, along with all physical matter and energy.</div>

<p>Third substance (AKA Catalysts):</p>

<ul>
<li>the bridge between the First and Second substances.</li>
<li>Introduce a catalyst into the equation, and suddenly the Second Substance can impact the First Substance.</li>
<li>As souls are a type of Second Substance, Catalysts are a type of Third Substance (and the only one).</li> 
<li>Catalysts can be split into 2 subcategories.</li>
</ul>

<p>A quick digression on dreams: there are two types of dreams in Cabezon.</p>

<ul>
<li>Soft dreams: are those that are truly just dreams- all animals have these dreams. They have no impact on anything.</li>
<li>Hard dreams: are significant, they occur in the realm Loulan where third substances can be formed. Ghosts can come into the dreams of dreaming agents, who are people who can have hard dreams. Any soul can come into a past dream through time travel, although what they can do in such a dream is limited.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">FIRST SUBSTANCE can impact SECOND SUBSTANCE. SECOND SUBSTANCE cannot impact FIRST SUBSTANCE, unless through a catalyst.</div>
</div>

<div id="catalyst-categories">
<h3>Catalyst categories</h3>

<p>Category 1 (Agent Catalyst): are used by agents.</p>
<ul>
<li>Immortalizing soul: is a soul who can make the body it inhabitats immortal (with the use of an elixir).</li>
<li>Time travel: is possible in the realm of dreams or ghosts. (?)</li>
<li>Curses: Some curses bring out a quality in someone that they already had a predisposition to, but without the curse would not have come into fruition.</li>
<li>Glitches: The nature of glitches can be altered by "zooming in and out" - making the glitches cover more ground (affect things to a bigger scale), or be miniscule (have only a small impact on things), and the frequency of the glitches occurrence.</li>
<li>Rifle spells: Are a class of spells that make someone (the person the spell is placed on) "shoot" into the future or past in an instance of time, in one way - that can be touch, smell, emotion, sight, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Category 2 (Base Catalyst): are not created by agents but affects them whether they like it or not.</p>

<ul>
<li>Splitting of souls/alter egos: souls are, at their healthiest, one and whole. When a soul is seemingly split into multiple facets (for example, if an aspect of a person is repressed, then that repressed part may try and escape the body in search for its "own life"), the conception of an alter-ego might occur. Alter-egos do not have a physical body but can nonetheless appear in the world and interact with it. The person who the alter-ego splits from may not even know that this split has occurred. If an alter-ego is not reunited with its original body for a long enough period of time, it will begin to search for a body to inhabit (remember that being body-less is unnatural). This may culminate in the alter-ego seeking the original body and pushing the other soul out of the body, causing that soul to become the alter-ego without a body, and thus the cycle repeats. It may also seek out a different body entirely. Ideally, the two (or however many) parts should reconcile and live in the same body.</li>
<li>Deformations: one form of shapeshifting occurs when a soul is put into a body that it is either not ready for, or not made for- "wrong fitted". This causes the body (which involves both the mind, so mental, and physical body) to be deformed in order to "make space" for the soul. For example, Jonas' soul was not suited for a human body, thus resulting in "deformation of the mind" (also called "chaos in the brain"), in the form of a constant permeating anxiety. Another example is Lepus, who has a "deformation of the body" (also called "chaos in the body", being a giant (like, two adult humans tall) rabbit.</li>   
<li>The Will of the Universe: Every universe has their own "Will". As far as the characters know, this "Will" is a person (and it is indeed, for their universe). All the Wills of the universes travel from universe to universe, but only in their own universe do they have some unique abilities (?).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div id="souls">
<h3>Souls</h3>
<p>Souls permeate through different stages of being. The reason for this is that souls have a body "in mind" that is suited for them, and it may take multiple instances to find the correct body, or to prepare to inhabit the proper body. Generally, the more fast physical movement that occurs for a body, the harder it is to inhabit, so it is most common for souls to inhabit celestial bodies at first before moving on to biological bodies.</p>
<p>No new souls are made since the beginning of the universe. Souls never die, they are immortal. Souls themselves cannot die. The physical body can become ill, and the more ill it becomes the closer it gets to death. However, this is not the case with souls- a soul can become very ill, but it will never become ill to a point where the soul stops working.</p>

<p>The states a soul can be in:</p>
<ul>
<li>in a body (living animal or celestial body)</li>
<li>or be a ghost. A ghost can be:</li>
<li>a wandering ghost, which most ghosts spend most of their time in,</li>
<li>or a figure ghost (such as Naomi and Lepus are) who take the form of something earthly.</li>
</ul>

<p>The ideal form for a being is to be a soul in a body- and within this, to be in the body that the soul was created for (for example, a soul may be created with an animal species or type of celestial body in mind, and the soul may cycle through many different bodies before it finds the correct one). A soul being without a body (a ghost) is either a temporary state (such as wandering ghosts) in which it is seeking a new body. Once it has found the correct body and that body dies, the soul lies dormant with the body- so one day all the souls will become dormant.</p>

<p>Fitted-ness: When a soul has found their fitted body. This is their final "life". When the body dies, the soul lays dormant with the body.</p>
<p>Wrong fitted-ness: When a soul has not yet found their fitted body, they will be "wrong fitted" while inhabiting their current body. All souls will one day be fitted.</p>

<p>Ghosts: What causes somebody to become a ghost? It happens when they die, but it doesn't happen to everybody. Ghosts of humans or animals occur when they are not ready to move onto the next stage. Their souls staying on Earth is purgatory. Sometimes, ghosts stay on Earth forever. For celestial bodies, becoming a ghost is a natural stage in their life- during this time they are wandering through the universe to find a place to reside after their bodies have been destroyed.</p>

<p>In short: Soul in a celestial body -> wandering ghost (majority of time spent here) -> how many other bodies -> in their fitted body -> laying dormant with their fitted body</p>

<div id="questions">

<h2>Questions to answer</h2>
<p>[[Cygnus lore]] - what goes wrong in Procyon and Cygnus' relationship that causes him to wrong her, and for her to hold a deadly grudge against him?</p>
<p>Who discovers Cygnus' crimes and punishes her for it? How do they have the power to kill her, choose her next body, and make sure she has her memories?</p>
<p>How does Don Diasco plan to preserve her curse for until Cygnus finds her next form? Time travel, Alpha Cygni? The children Ewe and Ram?</p>
<p>What happens after with Procyon, when a Don tells him that his children can be brought back to life?</p>
<p>[[Lepus lore]] - Everything about his goal to become a rabbit and his plan to gain the elixir has to be revised.</p>
<p>What crime did Lepus commit that caused him to be punished, dying then becoming a celestial body again? Who punished him?</p>
<p>[[About Cabezon]]: what exactly causes ghosts?</p>
<p>How exactly does time -> seemingly supernatural abilities and events?</p>
<p> [[The Dark Trail]] How is Don Diasco able to see what the crew have been getting up to?</p>
<p> How did he discover Jonas and Madeline?</p>
<p> Is the "Don Diasco" that messes with Cygnus and Lepus the same "Don Diasco" that messes with Jonas and Madeline? If not, make him a different character, give him a different name.</p>

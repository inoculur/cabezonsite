<h3>Stage 0</h3>  <p><i>[before the events of the main story and the characters. "Normal"]</i></p>
<p><b>Swan Mother Cygnus:</b></p>
<p>This is the tale that the characters hear at first. Whether it is wholly true or not, that we will find out later.</p>
<p>Relationship troubles with Procyon. Incident occurs (?). That night in her <a target="_blank" href="#substances">dreams</a>, visited by Don Harpo, who promises her the ability to shapeshift some of her facial features, which will allow her to wreck havoc on Procyon. The power is really a <a target="_blank" href="#catalyst-categories">curse</a>. Soon she will begin exhibiting further deformations of the body besides what she wished for, growing swan feathers. In reality, the Don just wanted to rid themselves of the curse.</p>
<p>Cygnus accepts the deal. Soon enough her face begins to transform. She is now stunningly beautiful and unrecognizable. She visits Father who is transfixed by her beauty. She is bitter and hateful but stomachs it in order to put her plan in place.</p>
<p>The two are married. Cygnus conceives two children.</p>
<p>The children, later called Ewe and Ram, are born. She planned to hang the both of them as revenge. Both children have the same curse as she does.</p>
<p>A year into the marriage the curse begins to take place. Cygnus finds swan feathers growing on her body. Plucking one off results in unimaginable pain, and the leaking of honey. Meanwhile, Cygnus practices the skill of transforming into a swan- not just her facial features. She is guided by Aman in her dreams.</p>
<p>Ewe and Ram begin to grow feathers at the age of 2. Cygnus plucks the feathers off them to hide the curse from their father.</p>
<p>Ewe and Ram are 7 years old. One day while their father is out at work, Cygnus brings them out telling them they are going out to the mountains. She pushes the both of them off and runs to collect their corpses. She carries their bodies back home and sets up two nooses and hangs them. In a box she places all their feathers and honey and takes this with her. She transforms into a swan to watchthe father's reaction. Cygnus has flown away.</p>
<p>When Father sleeps he sees a Don (same or different) as well, told that his children can be brought back to life.</p>

<p>Cygnus' crimes are discovered by ??? and she is sentenced to death. She wants to remove her curse and to preserve it for her next life (which she believes in because ???). She dreams in her cellar and sees the same Aman who gave her the curse in the first place, and asks how to preserve it. He tells her that it must be passed onto another person with a physical body (furthermore, the children both have the curse, so an opportunity is there, although Cygnus believes them to be dead).</p>
<p>She is slain and sent to the moon - the new house for the <a target="_blank" href="#soul">soul</a>. The old inhabiter of the moon is taken away, arranged by ???. As part of her punishment, she is to retain all her memories from her previous body.</p>

<p>The timeline of Cygnus' soul</p>
<ul>
<li>1: Celestial body (Alpha Cygni/ Deneb)</li>
<li>Wandering ghost</li>
<li>Animal</li>
<li>Human (where she meets Lepus as a human, receives the curse) **THIS IS WHAT YOU HAVE JUST READ**</li>
<li>2: celestial body (moon, punishment)</li>
<li>Wandering ghost</li>
<li>Animal (swan) **WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT TO READ**</li>
<li>Human (cursed, able to transform to and from)</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">Names (such as Lepus and Cygnus) are used to pick out those characters but at the time of this story you just read (as well as the following one) they were known by different names.</div>

<p>Later: Cygnus finds herself in the body of a cygnet (baby swan). She tries to gain control of the swan family (a mother and a few cygnets). When the mother departs (death or otherwise), she has her brood, and similarly to Lepus, still feels that inexplicable sense of yearning (see her and Lepus' entry in <a target="_blank" href="#characters">characters</a> for context.</p>
<p>She tries to gain more control - she becomes stricter and looks for more recruits - not just swans, but humans. She must attract a human recruit to the image of the swan (the self-image is a Lepus concept) - by implanting feathers on her body. Madeline is chosen, as she is wrong-fitted.</p>

<p><b>Evil Rabbit Lepus:</b></p>
<p>Lepus meets Cygnus in college (18-22), he's shy and lonely. Cygnus is sociable and smart. The two become close because of similar struggles. They begin a relationship. When they're out of school they live together. Years go by, they're no longer happy together. Lepus is struggling with lifelong insecurities, while Cygnus is growing bored and restless, and seeks excitement. Lepus truly loves her because she pulled him out of his depression and loneliness years ago. Cygnus (27) begins an affair with Procyon. Lepus is suspicious of this. Later after coming home from a party Lepus freaks out, expecting to find Procyon in the apartment with her. Cygnus takes his episode as a reason to leave, and she goes to live with Procyon.</p>

<p>Lepus dies and becomes a wandering ghost. It finds Jonas' dream. In the dream it was a rabbit, so it felt an affinity for rabbits since then, a compulsive one at that. It also began to view Jonas as a key figure in its destiny.</p>
<p>Lepus seeks out the body of a rabbit to occupy. However his soul is not fit for the body, so the physical body is deformed. But Lepus believes that his soul is fit. He wants to stay in this body, but he knows that soon he will die, and become a ghost. 
<p>Don Aman tells him about <a target=_blank href="#catalyst-categories">elixir</a>. He is also told about time travel (how?)</p>
<p>In order to obtain the elixir, he needs to access the world of dreams, which as an animal he cannot do. He needs the help of a dreaming agent, a human. Lepus doesn't want to abandon his body for too long (which he would have to do in order to obtain a human body for himself), so he plans to make a dreaming agent do the work for him.</p>

<ul>
<li>Find dreaming agent.</li>
<li>Trick them into making the elixir.</li>  
<li>Have the dreaming agent die -ensure they are also a wrong fitted soul so they can become a ghost.</li>  
<li>Kill Lepus' own physical body, so he can be a ghost- then steal the elixir from the dreaming agent's ghost.</li>  
<li>Return to his body with the elixir, immortalizing it and residing in it forever.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lepus finds himself in Cabezon. He remembers when he was a ghost, he found himself in a dream similar to this place, which was Jonas' dream. He sees Jonas at Cabezon and realizes that he is the perfect candidate for his plan. As an animal, he cannot talk, and realizes he will struggle to contact Jonas in the physical world- but he also cannot appear in Jonas' dreams again. First he tries to contact Jonas in the past by time travelling into the dream, but he finds that he is unable to change anything that he did in that dream, he has only superimposed his form (of the rabbit) onto whatever it was that used to be there in Jonas' dream- which is why Jonas sees a rabbit in his dream, and why Lepus becomes attatched to the form of the rabbit.</p>
<p>He decides that he will use somebody else (Naomi) as a communicator between them. Naomi will get Jonas' attention, and lead him to Lepus.</p>

<ul>
<li>1: Celestial body</li>
<li>Wandering ghost</li>
<li>Animal</li>
<li>Human (where he meets Cygnus as a human) **YOU JUST READ THIS**</li>
<li>??? (Why does he cycle again?)
<li>2: Celestial body (Alpha Leporis/Arneb)</li>
<li>Wandering ghost (he has the dream with Jonas and Cabezon) **YOU JUST READ THIS**</li>
<li>Animal (rabbit, wrong-fitted -> physical deformations, travels back to the dream, implants the image of rabbit) **YOU JUST READ THIS**</li>
</ul>

<p><b>First trip to Cabezon</b></p>
<p>Jonas and his friends (Jacob, Michael) came here on a trip in middle school. He told his friends about a mythical beast, an evil rabbit that would come and chase them down the beach. The inspiration for this beast came from that dream with Lepus (discussed in the paragraphs above). He does not believe that the beast is real.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Naomi is on her Schoolies trip with her peers.</p>

<h3>Stage 1</h3>  <p><i>["Normal", very close to our reality. the characters begin to discover seemingly supernatural things, but their world is largely normal. They go to school, have jobs, etc. (our main cast- jonas, etc, are in high school.)]</i></p>

</ul>

</div>

<div id="stage1.5">
<h3>Stage 1.5</h3> <p><i>[A peak of what's to come.]</i></p>

<ul>
<li>(12:00pm) Aaron takes an interest in Jonas due to his music taste.</li>
<li>(2:00pm) When they get out the car, they're told to wait for Madeline and Chelsea. This surprises Jonas and Aaron respectively. Gregg tells them all they need to do a bit of walking. The place they are at now is pretty sunny. Aaron is overheating but he refuses to take off his hoodie.</li>
<li>Aaron and Jonas talk while on the walk about music. Distracting both of them from Madeline and Chelsea, who are walking together, leaving Gregg in the front and Art in the back.</li>
<li>Gregg then joins Madeline and Chelsea, which changes to Gregg and Madeline. Jonas gets jealous over Gregg and Madeline - the two aren't particularly close, but they seem to have a very friendly and intimate dynamic. Aaron notices Jonas' mood, and hesitates before asking. Before he can,</li>
<li>(2:30pm) They arrive at the first bridge. Jonas notices the lack of signs or anything here, it clearly isn't a tourist spot - although Gregg mentioned that it was infamous. As they cross the bridge the grass changes to a greyish color, and soon there is hardly any grass at all, but only grey rock. To Aaron's dismay, it's still just as hot.</li>
<li>(3:00pm) The group is getting tired. Gregg suggests he goes on his own and the rest can stay here, or explore by themselves at their own pace. Art, his closest friend of the group, volunteers to go with him. Gregg gets everyone to take pictures of the map he saved from online (although it isn't very detailed - it only shows the path to the summit). They're very close to the flat field, just east of it. "Just try and find your way back East-ish, and go anywhere along this path."</li>
<li>Gregg and Art leave to climb up to the summit. Jonas, Aaron, Madeline and Chelsea walk to the flat field, and rest. Aaron wants to get away from the group, partly to get his clothes off since he's scorching. He leaves, saying he's gonna take a piss. He goes south-west into the nearby trees. This leaves Jonas with Madeline and Chelsea.</li>
<li>(3:30pm) It's been thirty minutes and Aaron is no where to be seen. Chelsea leaves to go find him, leaving Jonas and Madeline alone.</li>
<li><a href="#Don-diasco">Don Diasco</a> watches. It's now his time to strike. Everything has gone to plan so far, he just needs to lead the two to the terracotta cave. Speaking of the Don, where is he now? He's where the characters are, the Dark Trail.</li>
</ul>

<div class="note">Who is behind the Dark Trail? The place itself is an abandoned area, and the summit a popular place for urban exploration. Gregg first heard of it from an urban exploration forum. It peaked his interest. A user (Don Diasco) posted the map and, conversing with Gregg, advised him to bring a few friends. He also advises him against using google maps because it isn't accurate - he says there are no trees around the flat field. He creates the map that Gregg prints out - he knows that Gregg will follow the path, while the others will split off. He also advises that they pair up - because he knows Gregg will pair with Art, who is closest to him. That leaves Madeline, Chelsea, Aaron and Jonas. He knows Jonas will be too shy to hang out with Madeline, and he's never met Chelsea before, so that's sorted. He must ensure that something causes the two pairs to split up and for Jonas and Madeline to meet at the Terracotta cave. The Don's plan is to bring Madeline and Jonas together - everything from the Dark Trail is orchestrated by him. He gets the help of his friend Don Ceare who has the ability to input feelings into a soul's body, which she uses on Madeline to guide her to join the journey. She agrees to do this because she owes him a favor. Because Madeline is the one who had her brain meddled with, she is the most likely to discover that something strange has been going on. Although a lot of things have been orchestrated at first, not all key points have - Gregg befriended Jonas out of his own volition, that had nothing to do with the Don's meddling. Same with Jonas falling for Madeline - Diasco only saw an opportunity there (two potential lovers) and decided to get his hands dirty.</div>

<div id="introduction">
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>On Cabezon's third-substance reality:</p>
<p>The substance of the soul can materialise things in the physical world (eg. splitting of souls, ghost bodies, deformations, curses, immortalisation...) through time. Such power can come from the past, the future... (?)</p>
<p>Objects can exist in the past, the future, the present, or out of time - which is an abstract kind of place.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/time">"The universe is spread out in four similar dimensions, which together make up a unified, four-dimensional manifold, appropriately called spacetime."</a></p>
</div>

<div id="substances">
<h3>Substances</h3>
<div class="note">Please note that Cabezon's "substances" have nothing to do with drugs or alcohol.</div>

<p>First substance: the physical world. Described by science.</p>
<p>Second substance: The "soul" world. Concerned with consciousness. Some say that the second-substance categorization is moot (especially the practical Dons), however, it is conceptually necessary (especially considered to be by the logical Amans). </p>

<div class="note">All soul matter and energy was created in the big bang, along with all physical matter and energy.</div>

<p>Third substance (AKA Catalysts):</p>

<ul>
<li>the bridge between the First and Second substances.</li>
<li>Introduce a catalyst into the equation, and suddenly the Second Substance can impact the First Substance.</li>
<li>As souls are a type of Second Substance, Catalysts are a type of Third Substance (and the only one).</li> 
<li>Catalysts can be split into 3 subcategories.</li>
</ul>

<p>A quick digression on dreams: there are two types of dreams in Cabezon.</p>

<ul>
<li>Soft dreams: are those that are truly just dreams- all animals have these dreams. They have no impact on anything.</li>
<li>Hard dreams: are significant, they occur in the realm Loulan where third substances can be formed. Ghosts can come into the dreams of dreaming agents, who are people who can have hard dreams. Any soul can come into a past dream through time travel, although what they can do in such a dream is limited.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are also Property Locations. Locations which are infused with third-substance property. Example: the pool of Terracotta Cave. Unlike the dream world Loulan, however, these places are not second-substance worlds, because they are physically of the first-substance, they are only infused with a third-substance catalyst (Agent catalyst or Glitches). These have been placed by the Don Amans, way back when, during a war that was fought - these property locations were like trenches that served multiple purposes, such as allowing healing, rest, and crafting. These wars were a rehash, or an undoing, of previous wars.</p>

<div class="note">FIRST SUBSTANCE can impact SECOND SUBSTANCE. SECOND SUBSTANCE cannot impact FIRST SUBSTANCE, unless through a catalyst.</div>
</div>

<div id="catalyst-categories">
<h3>Catalyst categories</h3>

<p>Category 1 (Agent Catalyst): are used by agents.</p>
<ul>
<li>Immortalizing soul: is a soul who can make the body it inhabitats immortal (with the use of an elixir).</li>
<li>Time travel: is possible in the realm of dreams or ghosts. (?)</li>
<li>Curses: Some curses bring out a quality in someone that they already had a predisposition to, but without the curse would not have come into fruition.</li>
<li>Rifle spells: Are a class of spells that make someone (the person the spell is placed on) "shoot" into the future or past in an instance of time, in one way - that can be touch, smell, emotion, sight, etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Category 2 (Base Catalyst): are not created by agents but affects them whether they like it or not.</p>

<ul>
<li>Splitting of souls/alter egos: souls are, at their healthiest, one and whole. When a soul is seemingly split into multiple facets (for example, if an aspect of a person is repressed, then that repressed part may try and escape the body in search for its "own life"), the conception of an alter-ego might occur. Alter-egos do not have a physical body but can nonetheless appear in the world and interact with it. The person who the alter-ego splits from may not even know that this split has occurred. If an alter-ego is not reunited with its original body for a long enough period of time, it will begin to search for a body to inhabit (remember that being body-less is unnatural). This may culminate in the alter-ego seeking the original body and pushing the other soul out of the body, causing that soul to become the alter-ego without a body, and thus the cycle repeats. It may also seek out a different body entirely. Ideally, the two (or however many) parts should reconcile and live in the same body.</li>
<li>Deformations: one form of shapeshifting occurs when a soul is put into a body that it is either not ready for, or not made for- "wrong fitted". This causes the body (which involves both the mind, so mental, and physical body) to be deformed in order to "make space" for the soul. For example, Jonas' soul was not suited for a human body, thus resulting in "deformation of the mind" (also called "chaos in the brain"), in the form of a constant permeating anxiety. Another example is Lepus, who has a "deformation of the body" (also called "chaos in the body", being a giant (like, two adult humans tall) rabbit.</li>   
<li>The Will of the Universe: Every universe has their own "Will". As far as the characters know, this "Will" is a person (and it is indeed, for their universe). All the Wills of the universes travel from universe to universe, but only in their own universe do they have some unique abilities (?).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Category 3 (Glitches): Or rather, "Glitschen" or "Glide" The nature of glitches can be altered by "zooming in and out" - making the glitches cover more ground (affect things to a bigger scale), or be miniscule (have only a small impact on things), and the frequency of the glitches occurrence. Glitches can be utilized by agents. Similarly to the naming scheme of substances, the 3rd category can be seen as a bridge or relation between the 1st and 2nd.</p>

<div id="souls">
<h3>Souls</h3>
<p>"Souls permeate through different stages of being. The reason for this is that souls have a body "in mind" that is suited for them, and it may take multiple instances to find the correct body, or to prepare to inhabit the proper body. Generally, the more fast physical movement that occurs for a body, the harder it is to inhabit, so it is most common for souls to inhabit celestial bodies at first before moving on to biological bodies." - the blueprint hypothesis</p>
<p>No new souls are made since the beginning of the universe. Souls never die, they are immortal. Souls themselves cannot die. The physical body can become ill, and the more ill it becomes the closer it gets to death. However, this is not the case with souls- a soul can become very ill, but it will never become ill to a point where the soul stops working.</p>

<p>The states a soul can be in:</p>
<ul>
<li>in a body (living animal or celestial body)</li>
<li>or be a ghost. A ghost can be:</li>
<li>a wandering ghost, which most ghosts spend most of their time in,</li>
<li>or a figure ghost (such as Naomi and Lepus are) who take the form of something earthly.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>The "Blueprint Hypothesis", theorised by the Don Amans.</b></p>
<p>The ideal form for a being is to be a soul in a body- and within this, to be in the body that the soul was created for (for example, a soul may be created with an animal species or type of celestial body in mind, and the soul may cycle through many different bodies before it finds the correct one). A soul being without a body (a ghost) is either a temporary state (such as wandering ghosts) in which it is seeking a new body. Once it has found the correct body and that body dies, the soul lies dormant with the body- so one day all the souls will become dormant.</p>

<p>Fitted-ness: When a soul has found their fitted body. This is their final "life". When the body dies, the soul lays dormant with the body.</p>
<p>Wrong fitted-ness: When a soul has not yet found their fitted body, they will be "wrong fitted" while inhabiting their current body. All souls will one day be fitted.</p>
<p>

<p>Digression: the concept of fittedness that the Don Amans have put forward is wrong.</p>
<ul>
<li>Fittedness describes whether a soul's current body is their true, fitted body, that they will lie dormant with. The Don Amans came to this conclusion following observations and patterns.</li>
<li>The theory was dubbed "the Blueprint Hypothesis", as they theorised that a soul would have a "blueprint" for the ideal body.</li>
<li>They saw that a certain type of person would die and their soul would lie dormant. However, gaps began to appear: some people who did not fit the typical profile of a fitted soul would die and lie dormant, some people who fitted the profile did not lie dormant. This led them to the conclusion that although there is a profile of the typical fitted and unfitted soul, some people fall outside of it. However, in reality, it really meant that the concept of there being a distinction from the "fitted" and "unfitted" was flawed.</li>
<li>Lying dormant was hypothesized to be a state of "eudaimonia" - of calm, bliss, happiness. Since the distinction between the mind and the soul was less thought of back then, this concept made sense to them. In reality, it is true that the soul can experience eudaimonia while lying dormant in the body. Under the belief that the mind is a property of the body however, it might not make sense to say that the soul can experience anything after the body's death, since the mind would have died as well. The soul would then have no vessel through which to perceive anything. However, counterpoint, a soul can enter a celestial body and although its perception is not the same as an animals, it is a perception non the less- one that a celestial body itself does not have. It's the interpretation of perception, as well. A planet feels nothing, but the soul can perceive the nothing.</li>
<li>Example: Lepus. He has a dream as a wandering ghost - which is commonly conceptualised as a soul without a body. But it does have a body, just not a physical (first substance) body. What kind of body is it? A second substance body, for a second substance soul. It mocks (key term) the properties of a physical body, and serves the same function, but like magnets it repels its own and attracts and fits well with the other. Lepus also feels an affinity for rabbits. So a wandering ghost body can have feelings and desires, as well as some sort of drive. What kind of body is this? Is it somewhat like a second-substance weaved in the shape of a physical brain?</li>
<li>Where does this come from? How does the soul find this body? How was it created? Who created it? Well, it could only be the Don Amans - perhaps it was another type of Don Aman, a scientist - so not a Don or an Aman, but something else. An even more taboo kind of immortal.</li>
<li>Now before such brains were created, what would the natural course of the life of a soul be? Perhaps souls were intrinsically tied to bodies, a product of consciousness, and what the scientist does is separate all the "souls" from all the "bodies". Why?</li>
<li>One major flaw in the blueprint hypothesis is that all souls (second substance) are created along with physical matter (first substance) in the big bang, before "bodies" were a thing that the soul could "know" or have a blueprint for.</li>
<li>A different view may emerge: the Retroactive Hypothesis. That a soul has no intrinsic link or bond towards a body, but such a link may be formed.</li>
<li>The blueprint hypothesis states that all souls will lie dormant one day, except the immortal ones, who will live in their bodies forever.</li>
<li>The Don Amans, who are immortal, looked forward to this time. This also caused some of them to view the world in a somewhat flippant manner - leading to an attitude that is shared by many Don Amans. For example, Don Harpo wreaks so much havoc (even more than the average Don) and this would not be had he been raised in a different environment that valued non-immortal souls in a different light.</li>
<li>They also theorize that souls must learn pure evil and badness, as well as pure bliss and goodness. The "life" of a celestial body is pure good and the one of an animal pure evil. These two prepare the soul to inhabit a human body, which is a balance of the two. </li>

<p>Ghosts: What causes somebody to become a ghost? It happens when they die, but it doesn't happen to everybody. Ghosts of humans or animals occur when they are not ready to move onto the next stage. Their souls staying on Earth is purgatory. Sometimes, ghosts stay on Earth forever. For celestial bodies, becoming a ghost is a natural stage in their life- during this time they are wandering through the universe to find a place to reside after their bodies have been destroyed.</p>

<p>In short: Soul in a celestial body -> wandering ghost (majority of time spent here) -> how many other bodies -> in their fitted body -> laying dormant with their fitted body</p>

<h2>Characters</h2>
<div class="note">Ages listed are at the beginning of junior (11th) year for Jonas.</div>

<section id="Jonas">
<h3>JONAS</h3>
<p>Jonas is shy, but hot-headed, and extroverted if only he wasn't socially anxious. He can be a dick, but he is usually prohibited from being so by his own shyness. Ultimately he wants to rid himself of his jealousy and insecurity. He wants more friends, to be like <a href="#Gregg">Gregg</a> and <a href="#Art">Art</a>. He pursues <a href="#Madeline">Madeline</a>, who to him represents the uninhibited self, being genuine and present.</p>
<p><b>Jonas and Gregg</b> A jealousy forms towards <a href="#Gregg">Gregg</a>, who he views as someone who is very similar to him, yet so much more successful - he is in the same grade, yet he is friends with the seniors (who Jonas admires for how respected they are and their tight-knit friendships), and especially Madeline. In reality the two aren't even particularly close, but Jonas' perception makes it this way.</p>
<p><b>Jonas and Art</b> At first, Jonas finds <a href="#Art">Art</a> scary and intimidating (in band, he seemed to know what he was doing). He avoided him due to this. Later, he would admire Art for his dedication to his passions and strong resolve. Art began to take on a mentor/big brother role for Jonas.</p>
<p>Jonas is severely insecure about facets of himself, leading him to overcompensate with his massive ego and stubborn attitude. This personality means he feels like nobody recognises who he truly is because of his shy demeanor. The issue is he feels he can either be lonely and hide the worse parts of him, or he opens up and drives people away because of who he truly is. He needs to shed this belief, and find out how to open up without scaring people off, being genuine while being likeable.</p>

<ul>
<li>16</li>
<li>Junior</li>
<li>Pursued by <a href="#Lepus">Lepus</a></li>
</ul>

<p><i>His hair is long-ish (to above his shoulders), straight, black and jagged. Has goldish-peach skin, dark brown eyes and a round nose. Pretty much always wears square glasses. Height is somewhere from 5'2 - 5'3. Often wears a blue polo shirt with three stripes (two dark stripes, one light stripes), brown pants or shorts, and white sneakers.</i></p>

<section id="Madeline">
<h3>MADELINE</h3>
<p></p>

<ul>
<li>17</li>
<li>Senior</li>
<li>Pursued by <a href="#Cygnus">Cygnus</a></li>
</ul>

<p><i>Has long brown curly hair, height is 5'4, fair skin. In school, usually has hair tied in a pony tail, wears round glasses, and often wears a purple vest. Outside of school she might have her hair out, or have strands from the sides tied up to meet at the back of her head. She might wear round sunglasses. Often wears blue jeans that are wide at the bottom, with a black hoodie that hangs off her shoulders over a black top with thin straps. Her "formal" outfit is a gold princess-like dress, a gold tiara and purple slippers. Her merge with Cygnus gives her warm, redder skin, darker eyes, and an orange tinge to her hair. Her hair also becomes less curly and more wavy, and long. She wears a white, slightly translucent flowy dress which comes off her shoulders, similar to the one of Cygnus, but hers has golden jewelry at her waist. She also receives a golden band in her hair.</i></p>

</section>

<section id="Gregg">
<h3>GREGG</h3>
<p>Loves art, particular his photography, which he spends a lot of time on.</p>
<p><b>Gregg and Procyon</b> Procyon represents the "macho man" with no interest or respect for art that Gregg hates. Both of them have a relaxed attitude towards life - for Procyon this culminates in an asshole-like mindset that causes him to disregard the feelings and importance of others. Gregg is more healthy, having appreciation for his friends.</p>

<p><i>His hair is bleached blond at the tips, naturally dark brown. Skin is light. His face is quite angular, with a large-ish forehead. His eyebrows are quite bushy and straight, and he has a small dent in between them. His lips are quite puffy and his teeth are somewhat crooked. His nose is quite straight. His height is around 5'6. Often wearing a cool-dark-blue jacket with a purple t-shirt, black pants and white sneakers.</i></p>

<li>Senior</li>
<li>Younger sister: <a href="#Phoebe">Phoebe</a></li>
</ul>

<p><i>He has black curly hair that's cut very short, dark brown skin and an angular, straight nose. His eyebrows are straight and give off a naturally worried/calm look, similarly to Gregg. Height is 5'6. He often wears shirts (not t-shirts) - eg. a long-sleeve white shirt with pink stripes, and other interesting patterns. He'll often wear a belt and dress shoes with it as well (and also pants, such as light-brown chinos).</i></p>

<section id="Chelsea">
<h3>CHELSEA</h3>
<p>Known for being very smart, especially in the area of linguistics, which she is particularly passionate about.</p>

<ul>
<li>18</li>
<li>1st year uni</li>
<li>Friends with <a href="#Madeline">Madeline</a>, <a href="#Gregg">Gregg</a> and <a href="#Aaron">Aaron</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p><i>Her hair is completely straight, thin, and a light brown colour - in highschool she had it very short (up to her chin), with the back of her hair sticking out at the sides. She grew it out, and it's now quite long. She usually wears a pink head-band. Her eyebrows are very thin, her nose is round, and her lips thin. She is about 5'7 - 5'8. She usually wears casual clothes - such as a dark grey hoodie with pink strings and a short black skirt. She may wear leggings and boots.</i></p>


</section>

<section id="Aaron">
<h3>AARON</h3>
<p>He seems like a depressed loner to most people. Has a passion for arts that has been stifled by the pressure to go into "real" studies. The crowd he was with chipped away at his resilience and motivation, leading him to screw up his senior year - he wans't where he wanted to be. They were hostile towards many facets of him. Feeling like he was hated in "secret" - as soon as he stepped out of hiding they would all turn on him and drop the facade of tolerance.</p>
<p>Compare this with <a href="#Jonas">Jonas</a>, who also feels a disconnect with who he is and who others see him as (potentially a key theme of the story), and the subsequent punishment they both feel will happen if they reveal themselves for who they truly are.</p>
<p>Aaron is (was) in love with <a href="#Chelsea">Chelsea</a>, one of the only kind people in the same subjects as he. He latches onto her as the kind of person he wishes the others were like.</li>
<p>Aaron is, if not even more so, in love with art. He is deep into music, although he lacks the talent and drive to learn an instrument to a better standard. He picks up painting some time, too, representing a recovery from the mindset that shielded him from pursuing art, and his embracing of his passions.</p>
<p>The music that he likes reflects this too: during his first senior year he got really into electronic ambient music, because it was the type of thing he wouldn't ever want to make himself (although he enjoyed it). Listening to guitar-driven songs, he felt creative urges to make his own music, which he was trying to suppress. However, all his music tends to be slower and mellow.</p>

<ul>
<li>18</li>
<li>(Second time) senior year</li>
<li>Friends with <a href="#Gregg">Gregg</a> and <a href="#Chelsea">Chelsea</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p><i>Has greasy long-ish dark brown hair up to his chin, a fringe swept from the left side of his face to his right. A few hairs on his chin and upper lip, although he's meant to shave it for school. Angular down-turned nose, thin lips, hooded eyes and a soft jawline. He often frowns and looks mildly pissed. Usually wears a caramel-brown hoodie, dark blue jeans and white sneakers.</i></p>

<div class="note">Lepus and Cygnus: the two want to meet each other again, to reconcile, battle, etc. First, before realising they want to meet each other the two chase misguided goals. Lepus: to have a rabbit body. Cygnus: her wish for power and authority. The two first assume the bodies of animals on earth. Later they shift goals to merging (?) with Jonas and Madeline respectively, to use their bodies as vessels to come in contact with each other (?).</div>

</section>

<div class="note">Don Amans: The Dons and the Amans are the "scientists" of the Second and Third Substances. A split happens. Dons are more focused on application of the study while Amans do the pure side of things - logic and all. Something happened where the applied side of things started to go off the rails - they started fucking around with people, doing evil things, pranks... while the Amans tried to rein them in. Like <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Midsummer_Night%27s_Dream">shakespearian fairies and elves</a>, Dons like meddling with people and causing mischief.</div>

<section id="Don-diasco">
<h3>DON DIASCO</h3>
<p>He is inexperienced and naive. Loves pranking people and meddling with their affairs, much like other Dons, but he genuinely wants to help people romantically. He himself is starved for love. Later he messes with Jonas and Madeline (although he is trying to do them a favor by making them fall in love). Becomes a friend of the main crew much later on.</p>
<p>Diasco himself is cheeky, and loves to cause trouble and play pranks. However, he unconsciously believes that he is entitled to other people's business (their love lives) - especially that of non-immortalised souls (partly due to the culture around it all), something he pries into often. He believes he is doing a good thing (such as with Jonas and Madeline) but often, he makes things worse. He feels motivated to do this out of a lack of romance in his own life, and feelings of envy and missing out. He thinks that him being helpful will make others like him, similarly, he thinks his humour and people-pleasing will draw people to him (which it does - but not everything he does will succeed, and he will learn that). All this is because he feels like the duties to others means that they owe something to him - he should not feel entitled to love, either of his own or of others.</p>

<section id="Don-ceare">
<h3>DON CEARE</h3>
<p>Is very serious, usually. A flaw of hers is taking herself too seriously, and viewing others as below her - she often tries to cut off friendships because she deems them not good enough for her, and fears that they will drag her down. Her relationship with Diasco is tumultuous because of her going back and forth between wanting him as a friend, and not. She needs to learn that people are not going to be perfect, and neither is she. She is not as mature and knowlegable as she thinks herself to be and other people who seem stupid on the surface have much to offer that she never has considered.</p>

<ul>
<li>Age ???</li>

<li>Powers: casting spells - Rifle Tears (see <a target="_blank" href="#catalyst-categories">Category 1 (Agent Catalyst)</a>) the ability to input feelings into a soul's body.</li>

<h3>Questions about this website/project</h3>

<p>Things I used to make this website</p>
<ul>
<li>Notepad++</li>
<li>My brain</li>
<li>Computer (win 11)</li>
<li>PS: The stylesheet is pretty much completely ripped from an old website of mine.</p>
</ul>
<p>Things I use for Cabezon</p>
<ul>
<li>Obsidian, especially the canvas function, for the place to put all the notes. Most things on the website come from there.</li>
<li>For digital drawings, Krita, sometimes MS Paint.</li>
<li>For traditional: I use pencils from H to 2B usually, a 0.5  (HB or 2B) mechanical pencil (or whatever other pencil I have on hand). Sometimes: alcohol-based markers for colouring, watercolour, colour pencils.</li>
<li>Not sure about how the actual comic itself will be done.</li>
</div>

<div id="blog">
<h3>Blog</h3>
<p><b>3.2.24</b> Mostly been tweaking the CSS of the website and adding some sections. Next thing to do would probably be to make separate sections for each character, that way it'll be easier to link to them. Holidays are over so I'll have less time to work on Cabezon, I'll probably just be doing some art here and there. I'm working on the (more specific, realistic) appearances of Aaron and Chelsie, primarily.</p>
<p><b>11.2.24</b> I've split each character into its own section, which should make it easier to make links to them (which I've done for some in the story). Also did the CSS for the sections, changed it for the new and index sections as well.</p>
<p><b>14.2.24</b> Happy valentines, fixed some CSS stuff for mobile and different screens. As well as character appearance descriptions. I'll work on doing a drawing for each character section as well.</p>
